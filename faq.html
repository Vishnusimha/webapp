        <h4>How do I order?</h4>
        <p>For balloon bouquets that are in stock, simply add the bouquet to your cart and we'll deliver that special
            gift
            to your
            loved ones.

            For customized decorations or for bouquets that are out of stock, please fill out our form to request a
            quote,
            so we
            gather the necessary information for your event, after we spoke with you about your event, provided a quote
            and
            you have
            decided forward, we will send you our contract or invoice to your email. For invoices we will need a full
            payment to
            fulfill your order. For contracts, we need a 25% deposit of your order to secure your event on our calendar
            and
            it will
            not be refundable. After securing your order, we will schedule two payments to cover the rest of your
            balance,
            if these
            payments are not made two weeks prior to your event, we reserve the right to cancel your setup and you will
            forfeit your
            deposit.</p>

        <h4>What happens if after I have paid my down payment I decide to cancel my event? Can I have a refund?</h4>
        <p>No, you won't be able to get your refund since down payments are not refundable, but you can make a
            reschedule
            for your
            event, as long as we have the date available for the day you want to move your event, or we can transfer
            your
            down
            payment to someone else, as long as it pointed to the same package that your contracts says.</p>




        <h4>you have minimums?</h4>
        <p>
            Minimums apply only for Individual Corporate Services. Please fill out the contact form to inquire about
            minimums.
        </p>

        <h4>Can I pick up my order?</h4>
        <p>Sorry, at this moment we do not have a storefront. We are a Deliver only Business.</p>

        <h4>Can I order for delivery as a gift?</h4>
        <p>Yes, We are a Delivery only Business and we love delivering some smiles to your love one. NOTE that somebody
            must be
            present to accept the delivery. Deliveries are uniquely priced as delivery locations may vary</p>

        <h4>How soon should I place my order?</h4>
        <p>For bouquets that are in stock, you can order up to three days before your event, at this time we do not
            accept
            orders
            for the same day, in case you have ordered a bouquet for the same day, we will not be able to fulfill your
            order, and
            this will be canceled and your money will be refunded.

            For set ups, we ask that you place your order at least one month in advance.</p>

        <h4>I would like to order a Gender Reveal Set up or balloon bouquet, but I don’t want to know the baby’s gender…
        </h4>
        <p>No worries, your mom, sister, best friend or your doctor’s office can email us to share the results of your
            baby’s
            gender. We ask that you place your order with one month in advance to reserve your day, but we accept the
            gender
            results
            24 hours prior to your event.
        </p>


        <h4>How long do they last?</h4>
        <p>We can not guarantee the lifespan on your balloon, it just depends on how much direct sun, heat, cold, wind,
            etc. that
            it sees, however we do everything in our power to ensure our creations with last as long possible. But we
            are
            not
            responsible for how the weather may affect the set up or if any balloons pop after we deliver them safely to
            your event.</p>

        <h4>What happens to the balloons after my event ends?</h4>
        <p>You paid for your balloons, you keep them. After our team comes back to take down your set up, you have two
            options, the
            first is to keep all your balloons and second option, our team will have to pop them.</p>
