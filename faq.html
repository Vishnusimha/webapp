        <h4>Can I order for delivery as a gift?</h4>

        <h4>How soon should I place my order?</h4>
        <p>Minimum a month for large items & minimum 3 days for gift bouquets</p>

        <h4>I would like to order a Gender Reveal Set up or balloon bouquet, but I don't want to know the gender of the
            baby...
        </h4>
        <p>You need not worry; your mother, sister, closest friend, or your doctor's office can email us to communicate
            the gender
            test findings.
            In order to book your day, we suggest that you place your order one month in advance. However, we accept
            gender results
            up to 24 hours before your event.
        </p>


        <h4>How long do they last?</h4>
        <p>The lifespan of your balloon cannot be guaranteed by us; it simply depends on how much direct sunlight, heat,
            cold,
            wind, etc. it experiences. Nevertheless, we make every effort to prolong the lives of our balloons as much
            as is humanly
            feasible.
            However, we cannot be held liable for how the weather may impact the setup or if any balloons pop once they
            have been
            delivered to your event safely.</p>

        <h4>After my event, what happens to the balloons?</h4>
        <p>You own the balloons because you paid for them. You have two choices when our staff returns to break down
            your setup:
            either they keep all of your balloons or they have to be popped by our team.</p>
